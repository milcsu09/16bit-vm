# Assembler

This is the assembler that I use to assemble [simple programs](../examples/).
It's not in any way a finished project. There may be bugs in the assembler!
The current state of the assembler is more like a demo rather than a tool.

To be honest, I've gave up on making this assembler "good", the code is
sphagetti.

I will probably rewrite AGAIN in the future.
